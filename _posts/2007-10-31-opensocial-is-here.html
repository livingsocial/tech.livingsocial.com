					<p>As you may have seen on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/30/details-revealed-google-opensocial-to-be-common-apis-for-building-social-apps/">TechCrunch</a> and in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/technology/31google.html?em&amp;ex=1193889600&amp;en=7c3d672decfc4ffc&amp;ei=5087%0A">New York Times</a>, Google is days away from the developer launch of Open Social. </p>
<p>As a trusted tester/launch partner, we’ve been busy porting our social shopping suite (such as Visual Bookshelf) to OpenSocial. </p>
<p>I’ll follow up tomorrow with more thoughts, but I wanted to congratulate the OpenSocial team on the upcoming launch. We’re definitely excited!</p>
