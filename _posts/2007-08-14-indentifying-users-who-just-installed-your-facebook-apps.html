					<p>Sometimes it is useful to do some action on a Facebook user right after your application has been installed by the user. For example, you might want to push some default <span class="caps">FBML</span> to userâ€™s profile in case he does not complete the action you expect him to do after installation. Facebook application configuration allows to provide <em>Post-Add <span class="caps">URL</span></em> to route users to the destination url after the application install. It could be a dedicated <em>post_add</em> action or, in case of a default action where you have some code in the controller and since Facebook limits amount of redirects you can use, it could be a parameter to the url, like <code>&amp;init=true</code>, used to identify that it was a post-install action and execute on it.</p>
