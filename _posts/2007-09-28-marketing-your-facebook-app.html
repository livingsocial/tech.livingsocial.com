					<p>In the good ol’ days of, let’s say…. three months ago, life was simple. The birds chirped a bit louder, the grass was a little greener, and, best of all, you could build an app on Facebook, submit it to the directory, tag it with a category or two, and see it nestle in among a smattering of other applications and watch your traffic grow at an obscene pace. Those days are over. Kuput. Finito. Building an app on Facebook and letting it “do its thing” is an increasingly difficult, if not impossible thing to do. The good news is that there are a host of traditional and non-traditional ways to gather good, quality traffic for your application. The bad news is that, very likely, it’s going to cost you:</p>
<p>Buy an initial seed number of users: If you can generate 10/20/30 thousand users on your app, your installed user base should be large enough at that point in time to see if it sinks or swims. You’ll likely have crossed a wide-demographic range by that point in time and have been able to see if you’ve built your app to properly leverage the viral touch points and social graph.</p>
<p>Generate “off-Facebook” buzz: Sure, Facebook pages aren’t crawlable. And sure, your app can’t live outside of Facebook. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a universe (you know that thing… what’s it called… that’s right, the world wide web) that does still exist outside of Facebook. If you issue a web-based press release, it could get picked up by a variety of news sources who could reference it and Google will definitely crawl it. If you know any bloggers that would have an interest in your application, reach out to them and give them a sneak peak under the hood. If you have an existing destination site, leverage it! 40+ish million people are on Facebook, which means there is a reasonable chance the viewer of your destination site is also a Facebook member.</p>
<p>It’s in the name: This is certainly just a hypothesis, but I think a very reasonable one. If someone sends me an app, and I can immediately understand the concept of the app pre-install, I can make a decision point prior to installation about whether or not I think the app would be useful. I may not install it, but at least there is a chance that I will. If I don’t immediately grok how the app will work prior to install, there is no chance I will install it – what is it going to ask of me? Will I have to go out of Facebook to register for a site?</p>
<p>Just a few thoughts to consider when figuring out how to make your app go from 0 to 60(thousand users, that is) in 5 seconds flat.</p>
