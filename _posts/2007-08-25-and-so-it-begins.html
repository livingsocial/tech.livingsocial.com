					<p><em>And so it begins</em>. Welcome to the maiden posting for the Hungry Machine blog. We’re 4 guys bringing our expertise in Ruby On Rails and experience from <a href="http://aol.com"><span class="caps">AOL</span></a>, <a href="http://www.revolutionhealth.com/">Revolution Health</a>, and <a href="http://blockbuster.com">Blockbuster</a>  together to build some great new products and services. For those of you that read us at <a href="http://revolutiononrails.blogspot.com">RevolutionOnRails</a>, we have a new addition, Tim O’Shaughnessy, who will be handling a bit more of the product-side of the house for us.</p>
<p>We plan to continue exploring Rails, sharing our expertise with others via this blog and by releasing more plugins, and diving into new areas and applications, ranging from our continued development of Facebook applications to entirely new fields.</p>
<p>Lastly… why <em>Hungry Machine</em>? Well, we think it represents our mentality and effort we’ll put into our everyday activities… we’re hungry for success. Check back often to see what we’re up to.</p>
