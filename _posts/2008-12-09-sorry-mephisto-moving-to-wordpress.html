					<blockquote style="clear: both"><p>Dear Mephisto, you’ve been great. We’ve been dating for a while, and I didnt have any complaints. but I’m sorta sick of writing blog posts in your web UI. I heard there are plugins for 0.8 for metaweblog api support, but after putzing around with rails 2.0 vs 2.2, etc… I decided to break up with you. It’s really because I wanted to play with <a href="http://www.drinkbrainjuice.com/blogo" target="_blank">blogo</a>. No hard feelings. Lets be friends.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote style="clear: both"><p>Hi WordPress. How are you?</p></blockquote>
<p style="clear: both">We just ported our blog to WordPress. To import all our old content, I found <a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2008/03/25/thy-will-be-done-m2wppy-is-released" target="_blank">m2wp.pl</a>, which after adding some mysql patches, does a great job of generating a wordpress export file that imports perfectly from the WP admin UI. It was missing a few features, like correct author attribution, so I make some tweaks and put it on <a href="http://github.com/hungrymachine/mephisto_to_wordpress/tree/master" target="_blank">github</a> if anyone is interested.</p>
<p style="clear: both">BTW, whats blogo?</p>
<p style="clear: both"><a class="image-link" href="http://twitter.com/lrz/status/1041024849"><img style=" text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 10px;" src="http://blog.hungrymachine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/picture-32.png" alt="" width="400" height="168"></a>Sor far I like.</p>
<p style="clear: both">One feature request for us techies, an easy TextMate “insert code here” feature.</p>
<p style="clear: both">UPDATE: don’t forget to cp your assets.</p>
