   Assembling Pages Last: Edge Caching, ESI, and Rails<br></a>
</p>
<p>People asked some awesome questions, caught the edge cases I didnt want to cover which were complicated, like authorization/security, multi-level ESI includes, per page include limits, etc. The people at RailsConf are awesome. Thats totally why I enjoy these events.
