title: Permanent Link to Ruby Scoping Bug?

					<pre>class Foo
  def title
    "Oh hai."
  end

  def buggy
    puts title

    if false
      title = 'Oh noes!'
    end

    puts title
  end
end

Foo.new.buggy</pre>
<p>This code outputs:</p>
<pre>Oh hai.
nil</pre>
<p>Isnâ€™t it odd that the variable being created in an if-false block is still being created and set to nil?  Hopefully this is fixed in Ruby 1.9.</p>
