					<p>You haven’t heard from us for a while because we were working on a new project – <a href="http://livingsocial.com">LivingSocial</a> – the web-site that spreads across all major social networks (Facebook, Myspace, Bebo, Orkut) allowing people to talk to each other about their interests without barriers. We are going to speak more about it <a href="http://blog.livingsocial.com/">in a dedicated blog</a> while keeping this one for posts on Rails and other technologies.</p>
