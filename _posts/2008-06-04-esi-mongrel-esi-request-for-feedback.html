<br><br><p>The Railsconf08 talk on ESI &amp; Rails has sparked some interest in the community, and Todd, the core <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mongrel-esi/">mongrel-esi</a> maintainer, is asking for feedback on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mongrel-esi">mongrel-esi mailing list</a>.</p>
<p> The latest rumor is he is working on a <a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> port of mongrel-esi, which I have to admit sounds very interestingâ€¦</p>
<p> How are people planning to use ESI? Can anyone provide Todd with some feedback?</p>

  I'm wondering what is the main set of features preventing folks
today from using mongrel-esi in production?  Is it :

* performance
* documentation
* stability

If it's performance, can someone do some load testing maybe provide
some numbers and even some target numbers?  I am working on an
improved concurrency model, that should help improve page performance
for pages with lots of esi:include tags

if it's documentation, what's the missing bits, and can any of you
help out by filling in the gaps?

if it's stability, can you provide some samples that fail?
